At the moment I am learning the powerful [Yii Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) for my new [Restaurant Project](https://github.com/rajibmp/restaurant), and to use Yii framework with Nginx web server here I explore the nginx configuration. Usually the default Nginx configuration does work properly with Yii, but when it comes to Clean URL, then you cannot have advantage of using .htaccess like in Apache, we need different rewrite rules in Nginx configuration.

Not to make conflict with other Nginx configs, I have set this configuration to listen port 63 in my local machine. So, to access this you have to hit [http://localhost:63](http://localhost:63)

Good luck !!!
